### 交叉引用

## Cross References

You can cross-reference figures by adding an ID with the `fig-` prefix to them, and then referencing the figure using the `@` prefix. For example:

```
![An Elephant](elephant.png){#fig-elephant}

This is illustrated well by @fig-elephant.
```

## Subfigures

If you have several figures that appear as a group, you can create a figure div to enclose them. For example:

```md
::: {#fig-elephants layout-ncol=2}

![Surus](surus.png){#fig-surus}

![Hanno](hanno.png){#fig-hanno}

Famous Elephants
:::
```

Again, the last paragraph provides the main caption, and the individual figures carry the sub-captions. Here is what this looks like when rendered as HTML:

![An artistic rendition of Surus, Hannibal's last war elephant, is on the left. Underneath this picture is the caption '(a) Surus.' On the right is a line drawing of Hanno, a famous elephant. Underneath this picture is the caption '(b) Hanno.' The words 'Figure 1: Famous elephants' are centered beneath both pictures.](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/images/elephant-subfigures.png)

## Figure Panels

Above we demonstrate laying out two side-by-side figures with subcaptions and a main caption. You may or may not want the caption / sub-caption treatment, and you might also want to use multiple rows of figures. All of these variations are possible.

To layout two figures with their own standalone captions (and no main caption), just eliminate the `#fig` identifiers and main caption at the bottom:

```
::: {layout-ncol=2}
![Surus](surus.png)

![Hanno](hanno.png)
:::
```

![An artistic rendition of Surus, Hannibal's last war elephant, is on the left. Underneath this picture is the caption 'Surus.' On the right is a line drawing of Hanno, a famous elephant. Underneath this picture is the caption 'Hanno.'](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/images/elephant-figures-no-subcaption.png)

You can also eliminate the captions entirely:

```
::: {layout-ncol=2}
![](surus.png)

![](hanno.png)
:::
```

## 更花哨的设定

## Custom Layouts

The examples above used the `layout-ncol` or `layout-nrow` attributes to create straightforward layouts where all columns are of equal sizes. The `layout` attribute enables the creation of much more complex layouts.

For example, this defines a layout with two equally sized figures in the first row, then another image that spans the entire second row:

```
::: {layout="[[1,1], [1]]"}
![Surus](surus.png)

![Hanno](hanno.png)

![Lin Wang](lin-wang.png)
:::
```
